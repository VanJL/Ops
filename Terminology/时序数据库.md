## Introduction

时序数据库: time series database (TSDB)

A **time series database (TSDB)** is a software system that is optimized for storing and serving [time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) through associated pairs of time(s) and value(s).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database#cite_note-Various,_UCR,-1) In some fields, *[time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series)* may be called profiles, curves, traces or trends.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database#cite_note-2) Several early time series databases are associated with industrial applications which could efficiently store measured values from sensory equipment (also referred to as [data historians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_historian)), but now are used in support of a much wider range of applications.

In many cases, the repositories of time-series data will utilize compression algorithms to manage the data efficiently.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database#cite_note-Gorilla-3) Although it is possible to store time-series data in many different database types, the design of these systems with time as a key index is distinctly different from [relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) which reduce discrete relationships through referential models.[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database#cite_note-Asay,_TechRepublic,_2019-4)



时序数据是基于时间的一系列的数据。在有时间的坐标中将这些数据点连成线，往过去看可以做成多纬度报表，揭示其趋势性、规律性、异常性；往未来看可以做大数据分析，机器学习，实现预测和预警。

时序数据库就是存放时序数据的数据库，并且需要支持时序数据的快速写入、持久化、多纬度的聚合查询等基本功能。

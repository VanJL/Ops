## Setting kernel command-line parameters



### RHEL7

This section explains how to change a kernel command-line parameter on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems and IBM Power Systems servers using the **GRUB2** boot loader, and on IBM Z using **zipl**.

Kernel command-line parameters are saved in the `boot/grub/grub.cfg` configuration file, which is generated by the **GRUB2** boot loader. Do not edit this configuration file. Changes to this file are only made by configuration scripts.

**Changing kernel command-line parameters in GRUB2 for AMD64 and Intel 64 systems and IBM Power Systems Hardware.**

1. Open the `/etc/default/grub` configuration file as `root` using a plain text editor such as **vim** or **Gedit**.

2. In this file, locate the line beginning with `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` similar to the following:

   ```
   GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rd.lvm.lv=rhel/swap crashkernel=auto rd.lvm.lv=rhel/root rhgb quiet"
   ```

3. Change the value of the required kernel command-line parameter. Then, save the file and exit the editor.

4. Regenerate the **GRUB2** configuration using the edited `default` file. If your system uses BIOS firmware, execute the following command:

   ```
   # grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
   ```

   On a system with UEFI firmware, execute the following instead:

   ```
   # grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg
   ```

After finishing the procedure above, the boot loader is reconfigured, and the kernel command-line parameter that you have specified in its configuration file is applied after the next reboot.
